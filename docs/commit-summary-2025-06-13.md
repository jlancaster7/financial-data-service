# Summary of Changes Since Last Commit (2025-06-13)

## Overview
Major performance improvements and bug fixes to the financial data pipeline, focusing on bulk loading performance and market metrics calculation. Achieved 77% performance improvement and fixed critical data loading issues.

## 1. Performance Optimization - Bulk Insert Rewrite

### Problem
- Bulk inserts were timing out (5+ minutes for 1,256 price records)
- Root cause: Single-row inserts for ALL tables due to VARIANT column detection

### Solution
- Complete rewrite of `SnowflakeConnector.bulk_insert()` to use pandas `write_pandas()`
- Implemented intelligent fallback to `executemany` for certificate errors
- Skipped RAW layer for price data due to VARIANT performance issues

### Results
- Performance improved from timeouts to ~8 seconds for bulk operations
- Successfully loaded 5 years of historical data for 5 companies

## 2. Default Limit Bug Fix

### Problem
- Financial statement ETL defaulted to 5 periods when no limit specified
- User wanted unlimited data when no limit provided

### Solution
- Changed default from 5 to None in `run_daily_pipeline.py`
- Updated all financial statement methods in `FMPClient` to accept Optional[int]

## 3. Connection Pooling and Parallel ETL Fixes

### Problem
- Connection errors in parallel ETL execution
- Misleading log messages showing "Updated None records"

### Solution
- Added connection establishment before parallel execution
- Created `execute_with_rowcount()` method for accurate logging
- Fixed connection sharing across parallel ETLs

## 4. FACT_MARKET_METRICS Loading Issue

### Problem
- Only 21 records instead of expected ~6,280
- Complex CTE query timing out for large date ranges

### Solution
- Created batch loading script `load_market_metrics_batch.py`
- Process data in 180-day batches per company
- Successfully loaded all 6,280 market metrics records

## 5. New Scripts and Tools

### Data Loading Scripts
- `load_top_stocks_by_market_cap.py` - Load S&P 500 companies by market cap
- `load_market_metrics_batch.py` - Batch load market metrics to avoid timeouts
- `load_5year_data.sh` - Shell script for 5-year historical data load
- `load_commands.sh` - Common load commands reference

### Utility Scripts
- `truncate_all_tables.py` - Delete all data from all tables
- `truncate_fact_tables.py` - Delete data from fact tables only

### Documentation
- `docs/price-etl-performance-fix.md` - Detailed performance fix documentation
- `docs/market-metrics-issue.md` - Market metrics loading issue analysis
- `docs/market-metrics-fix-summary.md` - Summary of market metrics fix
- `docs/integration-test-plan.md` - Comprehensive integration testing plan

## 6. Test Development
- Started `test_integration.py` - Full pipeline integration tests
- Updated `test_snowflake_connector.py` for new bulk insert behavior

## Key Technical Changes

### SnowflakeConnector
- Replaced custom bulk insert with pandas write_pandas
- Added execute_with_rowcount() for accurate row count logging
- Improved VARIANT column handling
- Added connection pooling support

### Pipeline Changes
- Fixed parallel ETL connection sharing
- Removed default limit for financial data
- Added proper connection establishment before parallel execution

### Historical Price ETL
- Skip RAW layer due to VARIANT performance issues
- Updated logging to use execute_with_rowcount()

## Performance Metrics
- Pipeline execution: 77% faster (131s â†’ 29.6s per symbol)
- Bulk inserts: From 5+ minute timeouts to ~8 seconds
- Market metrics: Loaded 6,280 records successfully

## Data Loaded
- 5 companies: MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL
- Date range: 2020-06-13 to 2025-06-12
- Total records:
  - FACT_DAILY_PRICES: 6,280
  - FACT_FINANCIALS: 106
  - FACT_FINANCIALS_TTM: 91
  - FACT_FINANCIAL_RATIOS: 101
  - FACT_MARKET_METRICS: 6,280

## Known Issues
- Certificate validation errors with write_pandas (fallback handles it)
- Market metrics query still slow for large date ranges (mitigated by batching)

## Next Steps
- Continue with integration testing (Story 7.2)
- Consider optimizing market metrics CTE query
- Investigate certificate validation issues
