# Testing Summary

## Test Results ✅

All connection tests have passed successfully!

### Snowflake Connection
- ✅ Connected to Snowflake with EQUITY_DATA_LOADER role
- ✅ Database EQUITY_DATA created and accessible
- ✅ All schemas created: RAW_DATA, STAGING, ANALYTICS
- ✅ All tables created in each schema
- ✅ DIM_DATE populated with 4018 rows (2020-2030)
- ✅ Warehouse EQUITY_LOAD_WH created and active

### FMP API Connection

  - Historical prices endpoint (with date filtering)
  - Income statement endpoint
  - Balance sheet endpoint
  - Cash flow statement endpoint
  - Financial ratios TTM
  - Key metrics TTM
  - Historical market cap
  - S&P 500 constituents (503 companies)

- ✅ Rate limiting functioning correctly

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file has been configured with:
- Snowflake credentials and connection details
- FMP API key and correct base URL (`https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3`)
- Application settings (logging, batch size, rate limits)

## What Was Completed

### Sprint 1 Stories (All Completed ✅)
1. **Story 1.1: Set up Snowflake Environment**
   - Created database, warehouse, schemas, and tables
   - Set up roles and permissions
   - Populated date dimension table

2. **Story 1.2: Set up Development Environment**
   - Created project structure
   - Set up Python dependencies
   - Configured environment variables

3. **Story 1.3: Configure Snowflake Connection Module**
   - Implemented robust connection handling
   - Created methods for all database operations
   - Added connection pooling and error handling

4. **Story 2.1: Implement FMP API Client**
   - Created API client with rate limiting
   - Implemented all required endpoints
   - Added batch processing capabilities

## Test Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/test_connections.py`** - Full connection tests with all features
2. **`scripts/test_initial_connections.py`** - Basic connectivity tests  
3. **`scripts/setup_snowflake.py`** - Standard Snowflake setup script
4. **`scripts/setup_snowflake_admin.py`** - Database setup script with ACCOUNTADMIN role
5. **`scripts/test_fmp_stable.py`** - Comprehensive test of all FMP stable API endpoints

## FMP API Implementation Notes

The FMP client has been fully updated to use the official `/stable/` API endpoints:
- All endpoints now use query parameters as documented
- No API version switching required
- Consistent interface across all endpoints
- Full compatibility with the provided `fmp-api-docs.md`

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)

The foundation is ready! You can now proceed with Sprint 2 to implement the ETL pipeline:

1. **Story 3.1: Create ETL Pipeline Framework**
   - Base ETL classes
   - Error handling and logging
   - Pipeline orchestration

2. **Story 3.2: Extract Company Data**
   - Fetch company profiles from FMP
   - Load into RAW_COMPANY_PROFILE table

3. **Story 3.3: Extract Historical Price Data**
   - Fetch price history from FMP
   - Load into RAW_HISTORICAL_PRICES table

4. **Story 4.1: Extract Financial Statement Data**
   - Fetch income statements, balance sheets, cash flows
   - Load into respective raw tables

5. **Story 4.2: Create Staging Layer Transformations**
   - Transform raw JSON to structured data
   - Load into staging tables

## Running the Tests

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run connection tests
python scripts/test_connections.py

# Run unit tests
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `.env` file has correct credentials
2. Ensure Snowflake warehouse is running (auto-resume is enabled)
3. Verify FMP API key hasn't exceeded rate limits
4. Check network connectivity to both services
