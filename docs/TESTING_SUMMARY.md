## What Was Completed

### Sprint 1 Stories (All Completed âœ…)
1. **Story 1.1: Set up Snowflake Environment**
   - Created database, warehouse, schemas, and tables
   - Set up roles and permissions
   - Populated date dimension table

2. **Story 1.2: Set up Development Environment**
   - Created project structure
   - Set up Python dependencies
   - Configured environment variables

3. **Story 1.3: Configure Snowflake Connection Module**
   - Implemented robust connection handling
   - Created methods for all database operations
   - Added connection pooling and error handling

4. **Story 2.1: Implement FMP API Client**
   - Created API client with rate limiting
   - Implemented all required endpoints
   - Added batch processing capabilities

## Test Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/test_connections.py`** - Full connection tests with all features
2. **`scripts/test_initial_connections.py`** - Basic connectivity tests  
3. **`scripts/setup_snowflake.py`** - Standard Snowflake setup script
4. **`scripts/setup_snowflake_admin.py`** - Database setup script with ACCOUNTADMIN role
5. **`scripts/test_fmp_stable.py`** - Comprehensive test of all FMP stable API endpoints

## FMP API Implementation Notes

The FMP client has been fully updated to use the official `/stable/` API endpoints:
- All endpoints now use query parameters as documented
- No API version switching required
- Consistent interface across all endpoints
- Full compatibility with the provided `fmp-api-docs.md`

## Sprint 2 Completion Summary âœ…

### Completed Stories

1. **Story 2.2: Create Data Transformation Logic** âœ…
   - Created data models for all FMP data types
   - Implemented transformation utilities with batch support
   - Added comprehensive data quality validation
   - Custom DateTimeEncoder for proper JSON serialization

2. **Story 3.1: Create ETL Pipeline Framework** âœ…
   - Abstract base ETL framework with retry logic
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Monitoring hooks for observability
   - Comprehensive error handling and status tracking

3. **ETL Monitoring Infrastructure** âœ…
   - Created monitoring tables in Snowflake
   - ETL job history tracking
   - Error and metric persistence
   - Data quality issue logging

4. **Story 3.2: Extract Company Data** âœ…
   - Successfully extracts company profiles from FMP API
   - Loads data to RAW_COMPANY_PROFILE (VARIANT) and STG_COMPANY_PROFILE
   - Updates DIM_COMPANY with SCD Type 2 logic
   - Market cap categorization and headquarters formatting

### VARIANT Column Solution

After extensive testing, we resolved Snowflake VARIANT column challenges:
- **Problem**: executemany doesn't support PARSE_JSON in VALUES clause
- **Solution**: Single-row INSERT with PARSE_JSON for each record
- **Trade-off**: Slower but reliable for current data volumes
- **Future**: Consider staging table approach for larger datasets

### Test Results

```bash
# All unit tests passing
pytest tests/
============================== 60 passed in 0.80s ==============================
```

### Data Verification

Successfully loaded company data to Snowflake:
- RAW_DATA.RAW_COMPANY_PROFILE: 3 rows (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
- STAGING.STG_COMPANY_PROFILE: 3 rows (structured data)
- ANALYTICS.DIM_COMPANY: 3 rows (dimension table with SCD Type 2)
- ETL_JOB_HISTORY: Tracking all job executions

## Sprint 3 Progress Update

### Completed Stories

1. **Story 3.3: Extract Historical Price Data** âœ…
   - Implemented historical price ETL pipeline
   - Extracts data from FMP API with date range support
   - Loads to RAW_HISTORICAL_PRICES and STG_HISTORICAL_PRICES
   - Updates FACT_DAILY_PRICES with calculated metrics
   - **Key Achievement**: Implemented MERGE for staging tables to prevent duplicates
   - Batch processing for handling large symbol lists efficiently

### Duplicate Prevention Solution âœ…
- **Problem**: Running ETL multiple times created duplicates in staging tables
- **Solution**: Added `merge()` method to SnowflakeConnector
  - Uses temporary tables with MERGE statement
  - Configurable merge keys (symbol, price_date for prices)
  - Ensures idempotent pipeline execution

### Data Verification
Successfully loaded historical price data:
- RAW_DATA.RAW_HISTORICAL_PRICES: With VARIANT storage
- STAGING.STG_HISTORICAL_PRICES: Structured price data (using MERGE)
- ANALYTICS.FACT_DAILY_PRICES: With calculated change metrics

## Next Steps (Sprint 3 Continued)

1. **Story 4.1: Extract Financial Statement Data** ðŸš§ NEXT
   - Income statements, balance sheets, cash flows
   - Quarterly and annual data handling

2. **Story 4.2: Create Staging Layer Transformations**
   - SQL/Python transformations for financial data
   - Handle complex financial metrics

3. **Story 5.1: Create Main Pipeline Orchestrator**
   - Orchestrate all ETL jobs
   - Add scheduling capabilities

## Running the Tests

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run connection tests
python scripts/test_connections.py

# Run unit tests
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `.env` file has correct credentials
2. Ensure Snowflake warehouse is running (auto-resume is enabled)
3. Verify FMP API key hasn't exceeded rate limits
4. Check network connectivity to both services
