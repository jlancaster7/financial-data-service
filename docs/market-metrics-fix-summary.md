# FACT_MARKET_METRICS Loading Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Successfully fixed the FACT_MARKET_METRICS loading issue where only 21 records existed instead of the expected ~6,280.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Query Timeout**: The market metrics extraction query with complex CTEs was timing out when processing large date ranges (>180 days) due to Snowflake certificate errors
2. **Default Date Range**: The pipeline defaulted to only 30 days when no date range was specified
3. **Incremental Processing**: The ETL had an EXISTS check preventing re-processing of already calculated metrics

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Batch Loading Script**: `scripts/load_market_metrics_batch.py`
   - Processes data in smaller date batches (180 days) to avoid timeouts
   - Processes each company separately to reduce query complexity
   - Uses connection pooling for better performance

2. **Cleared Existing Data**: Deleted the 21 MSFT records and reloaded from scratch

3. **Full Historical Load**: Loaded all 5 companies for the full date range (2020-06-13 to 2025-06-12)

## Results

- **Total Records**: 6,280 (exactly as expected)
- **Per Company**: 1,256 records each
- **Date Coverage**: 2020-06-15 to 2025-06-12 for all companies
- **Metrics Calculated**: P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, and more

## Performance Notes

- Batch processing took approximately 2-3 minutes total
- Each 180-day batch for one company took ~2-5 seconds
- Certificate errors occurred with write_pandas but fallback to executemany worked reliably

## Future Improvements

1. **Optimize Query**: Consider simplifying the CTEs or using materialized views
2. **Increase Batch Size**: Could potentially handle larger batches (e.g., 365 days)
3. **Fix Certificate Issue**: Investigate and resolve the S3 certificate validation errors
4. **Add Progress Tracking**: Implement better progress reporting for long-running loads
