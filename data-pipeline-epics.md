5. Build Streamlit dashboard for monitoring
6. Implement incremental loading for historical data
7. Add support for real-time data feeds

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk:** FMP API changes or downtime

2. **Risk:** Snowflake costs exceed budget  
   **Mitigation:** Monitor query costs, optimize clustering keys

3. **Risk:** Pipeline fails silently  
   **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

4. **Risk:** Data quality issues go unnoticed  
   **Mitigation:** Add data validation in Sprint 5 if time permits
